# SudokuLanguajeComparison

What is this?
A sudoku solver implementation using backtracking in 3 different languajes, C, Python, and Java.

How do I use it?
Download it in a unix system, that has gcc, javac, python3 and Make tools.
For C benchmark use:  time ./SudokuSolverC/exe/sudokutest 
For Python benchmark use: time ./SudokuSolverPy/SudokuSolver.py 
For Java benchmark use: time java SudokuSolverJava/Sudoku

How do I redirect the "time" output to a file?
No clue, but e-mail me if you find the answer (Not joking, link is in the profile).

Which is the fastest languaje?
C > Python > Java. (">" means faster)

Why is java code so awfull?
I don't like that languaje and I didn't want to break my head thinking how to import stuff.
